CUDA Implementation Pseudocode

Variables:
    n : number of elements to sorted
    t : number of threads
    A : array to be sorted

Idea: avoid coordination between threads by strategically launching kernels
      and subsequently synchronzing.

Main Procedure:
    1. Copy A to GPU memory
    2. for each phase:
    3.   if even:
    4.     <<<even>>>
    5.   else:
    6.     <<<odd>>>
    7.   synchronize 
    8. Copy A to device memory

Kernel Procedure for odd phase:
    1. calculate i
    2. calculate partner thread index
    3. compare and swap with partner

Kernel Procedure for even phase:
    1. calculate i
    2. calculate partner thread index
    3. compare and swap with partner
