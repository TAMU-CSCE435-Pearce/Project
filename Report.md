# CSCE 435 Group project

## 0. Group number: 

## 1. Group members:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
4. Fourth

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

For example:
- Algorithm 1a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 1b (MPI on each core)
- Algorithm 2a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 2b (MPI on each core)

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes
- For CUDA programs, indicate which computation will be performed in a CUDA kernel,
  and where you will transfer data to/from GPU

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
- Number of threads in a block on the GPU 


## 3. Project implementation
Implement your proposed algorithms, and test them starting on a small scale.
Instrument your code, and turn in at least one Caliper file per algorithm;
if you have implemented an MPI and a CUDA version of your algorithm,
turn in a Caliper file for each.

### 3a. Caliper instrumentation
Please use the caliper build `/scratch/group/csce435-f23/Caliper/caliper/share/cmake/caliper` 
(same as lab1 build.sh) to collect caliper files for each experiment you run.

Your Caliper regions should resemble the following calltree
(use `Thicket.tree()` to see the calltree collected on your runs):
```
main
|_ data_init
|_ comm
|    |_ MPI_Barrier
|    |_ comm_small  // When you broadcast just a few elements, such as splitters in Sample sort
|    |   |_ MPI_Bcast
|    |   |_ MPI_Send
|    |   |_ cudaMemcpy
|    |_ comm_large  // When you send all of the data the process has
|        |_ MPI_Send
|        |_ MPI_Bcast
|        |_ cudaMemcpy
|_ comp
|    |_ comp_small  // When you perform the computation on a small number of elements, such as sorting the splitters in Sample sort
|    |_ comp_large  // When you perform the computation on all of the data the process has, such as sorting all local elements
|_ correctness_check
```

Required code regions:
- `main` - top-level main function.
    - `data_init` - the function where input data is generated or read in from file.
    - `correctness_check` - function for checking the correctness of the algorithm output (e.g., checking if the resulting data is sorted).
    - `comm` - All communication-related functions in your algorithm should be nested under the `comm` region.
      - Inside the `comm` region, you should create regions to indicate how much data you are communicating (i.e., `comm_small` if you are sending or broadcasting a few values, `comm_large` if you are sending all of your local values).
      - Notice that auxillary functions like MPI_init are not under here.
    - `comp` - All computation functions within your algorithm should be nested under the `comp` region.
      - Inside the `comp` region, you should create regions to indicate how much data you are computing on (i.e., `comp_small` if you are sorting a few values like the splitters, `comp_large` if you are sorting values in the array).
      - Notice that auxillary functions like data_init are not under here.

All functions will be called from `main` and most will be grouped under either `comm` or `comp` regions, representing communication and computation, respectively. You should be timing as many significant functions in your code as possible. **Do not** time print statements or other insignificant operations that may skew the performance measurements.

**Nesting Code Regions** - all computation code regions should be nested in the "comp" parent code region as following:
```
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp");
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp_large");
mergesort();
CALI_MARK_END("comp_large");
CALI_MARK_END("comp");
```

**Looped GPU kernels** - to time GPU kernels in a loop:
```
### Bitonic sort example.
int count = 1;
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp");
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp_large");
int j, k;
/* Major step */
for (k = 2; k <= NUM_VALS; k <<= 1) {
    /* Minor step */
    for (j=k>>1; j>0; j=j>>1) {
        bitonic_sort_step<<<blocks, threads>>>(dev_values, j, k);
        count++;
    }
}
CALI_MARK_END("comp_large");
CALI_MARK_END("comp");
```

**Calltree Examples**:

```
# Bitonic sort tree - CUDA looped kernel
1.000 main
├─ 1.000 comm
│  └─ 1.000 comm_large
│     └─ 1.000 cudaMemcpy

└─ 1.000 data_init
```

```

└─ 1.000 data_init
```

### 3b. Collect Metadata

Have the following `adiak` code in your programs to collect metadata:
```
adiak::init(NULL);
adiak::launchdate();    // launch date of the job
adiak::libraries();     // Libraries used
adiak::cmdline();       // Command line used to launch the job
adiak::clustername();   // Name of the cluster
adiak::value("algorithm", algorithm); // The name of the algorithm you are using (e.g., "merge", "bitonic")
adiak::value("programming_model", programming_model); // e.g., choices: ("mpi", "cuda")
adiak::value("data_type", data_type); // The datatype of input elements (e.g., double, int, float)
adiak::value("size_of_data_type", size_of_data_type); // sizeof(datatype) of input elements in bytes (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
adiak::value("input_size", input_size); // The number of elements in input dataset (1000)
adiak::value("input_type", input_type); // For sorting, this would be choices: ("Sorted", "ReverseSorted", "Random", "1_perc_perturbed")
adiak::value("num_procs", num_procs); // The number of processors (MPI ranks)
adiak::value("num_threads", num_threads); // The number of CUDA or OpenMP threads
adiak::value("num_blocks", num_blocks); // The number of CUDA blocks 
adiak::value("scalability", scalability); // The scalability of your algorithm. choices: ("strong", "weak")
adiak::value("group_num", group_number); // The number of your group (integer, e.g., 1, 10)
adiak::value("implementation_source", implementation_source) // Where you got the source code of your algorithm. choices: ("online", "ai", "handwritten").
```

They will show up in the `Thicket.metadata` if the caliper file is read into Thicket.

**See the `Builds/` directory to find the correct Caliper configurations to get the above metrics for CUDA, MPI, or OpenMP programs.** They will show up in the `Thicket.dataframe` when the Caliper file is read into Thicket.

## 4. Performance evaluation

Include detailed analysis of computation performance, communication performance. 
Include figures and explanation of your analysis.

### 4a. Vary the following parameters
For input_size's:
- 2^16, 2^18, 2^20, 2^22, 2^24, 2^26, 2^28

For input_type's:
- Sorted, Random, Reverse sorted, 1%perturbed

num_procs, num_threads:
- MPI: num_procs:
    - 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024
- CUDA: num_threads:
    - 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024

This should result in 4x7x10=280 Caliper files for your MPI experiments.

### 4b. Hints for performance analysis

To automate running a set of experiments, parameterize your program.

- input_type: If you are sorting, "Sorted" could generate a sorted input to pass into your algorithms
- algorithm: You can have a switch statement that calls the different algorithms and sets the Adiak variables accordingly
- num_procs:   How many MPI ranks you are using
- num_threads: Number of CUDA or OpenMP threads

When your program works with these parameters, you can write a shell script 
that will run a for loop over the parameters above (e.g., on 64 processors, 
perform runs that invoke algorithm2 for Sorted, ReverseSorted, and Random data).  

### 4c. You should measure the following performance metrics
- `Time`
    - Min time/rank
    - Max time/rank
    - Avg time/rank
    - Total time
    - Variance time/rank
    - `If GPU`:
        - Avg GPU time/rank
        - Min GPU time/rank
        - Max GPU time/rank
        - Total GPU time

`Intel top-down`: For your CPU-only experiments on the scale of a single node, you should
generate additional performance data, measuring the hardware counters on the CPU. This can be done by adding `topdown.all` to the `spot()` options in the `CALI_CONFIG` in your jobfile.

## 5. Presentation
Plots for the presentation should be as follows:
- For each implementation:
    - For each of comp_large, comm, and main:
        - Strong scaling plots for each input_size with lines for input_type (7 plots - 4 lines each)
        - Strong scaling speedup plot for each input_type (4 plots)
        - Weak scaling plots for each input_type (4 plots)

Analyze these plots and choose a subset to present and explain in your presentation.

## 6. Final Report
Submit a zip named `TeamX.zip` where `X` is your team number. The zip should contain the following files:
- Algorithms: Directory of source code of your algorithms.
- Data: All `.cali` files used to generate the plots seperated by algorithm/implementation.
- Jupyter notebook: The Jupyter notebook(s) used to generate the plots for the report.
- Report.md
