## 2. _due 10/25_ Project topic
For our project topic, we are going to be exploring parellel algoithm for sorting.
## 2. _due 10/25_ Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

Sources for the code and all 

The algorithm that we are going to use:

1. Selection sort 

2. Insertion sort

3. Quicksort

<!-- 
For example:
- Algorithm 1a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 1b (MPI on each core)
- Algorithm 2a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 2b (MPI on each core) -->
