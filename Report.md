## 2. _due 10/25_ Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

For the duration of this project, our team plans on communicating via Slack. 

For our algorithms, we plan on implementing various sorting algorithms. The three sorting algorithms we are planning on implementing are Bubble sort, Merge Sort, and Quick sort. 

For each of the algorithms, we are planning on implementating in both OpenMP and CUDA so that we can compare the differences in CPU vs. GPU parallelization. Not only will we be comparing the differences in CPU and GPU speed but we will also be testing the differences in the algorithms on various types of inputs. For example, we might run each algorithm on a completely random input, then on a partially sorted one, then on a completely sorted one. 

## Psuedocode for Algorithms

For example:
- Algorithm 1a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 1b (MPI on each core)
- Algorithm 2a (MPI + CUDA)
- Algorithm 2b (MPI on each core)
